Instructions to execute the script naveethabhilash which performs retiming for clock period minimization

1.The inputs to the program should be provided through the text file input.txt.
2.The format of input in input.txt is as follows:
a.numberofnodes numberofedges 0
b.node nodecomputationtime 0
c.sourcenode destinationnode edgeweight
3.Repeat the steps b and c as many times as the number of nodes and number of edges in your graph.
4.Execute the script naveethabhilash
5.The script displays input graph, retiming values, retimed graph, clock period of input graph and clock period of retimed graph in the command window.
6.W and D matrices of input graph and retimed graph are named as W and D and W1 and D1.
7.Constraint graph is represented as congraph.
